(doorbell rings)
00:02
WELL, SEYMOUR, I MADE IT
00:03
DESPITE YOUR DIRECTIONS.
00:05
SUPERINTENDENT CHALMERS, WELCOME.
00:07
I HOPE YOU'RE PREPARED FOR AN UNFORGETTABLE LUNCHEON.
00:09
YEAH.
00:14
OH, YE GODS!
00:16
MY ROAST IS RUINED.
00:19
BUT WHAT IF...
00:21
I WERE TO PURCHASE FAST FOOD
00:22
AND DISGUISE IT AS MY OWN COOKING?
00:25
HO-HO-HO-HO-HO.
00:28
(theme music plays)
00:30
â™ª SKINNER, WITH HIS CRAZY EXPLANATIONS â™ª
00:33
â™ª THE SUPERINTENDENT'S GONNA NEED HIS MEDICATION â™ª
00:36
â™ª WHEN HE HEARS SKINNER'S LAME EXAGGERATIONS â™ª
00:39
â™ª THERE'LL BE TROUBLE IN TOWN TONIGHT â™ª
00:41
SEYMOUR!
00:42
SUPERINTENDENT!
00:44
WHY IS THERE SMOKE COMING OUT OF YOUR OVEN, SEYMOUR?
00:46
UH... OH! THAT ISN'T SMOKE.
00:48
IT'S STEAM.
00:49
STEAM FROM THE STEAMED CLAMS WE'RE HAVING.
00:51
MMM, STEAMED CLAMS.
00:58
SUPERINTENDENT, I HOPE YOU'RE READY
01:00
FOR MOUTH-WATERING HAMBURGERS.
01:01
I THOUGHT WE WERE HAVING STEAMED CLAMS.
01:04
OH, NO, I SAID "STEAMED HAMS."
01:07
THAT'S WHAT I CALL HAMBURGERS.
01:08
YOU CALL HAMBURGERS "STEAMED HAMS"?
01:11
IT'S A REGIONAL DIALECT.
01:12
WHAT REGION?
01:13
UH, UPSTATE NEW YORK.
01:15
REALLY? WELL, I'M FROM UTICA
01:17
AND I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYONE USE THE PHRASE "STEAMED HAMS."
01:20
OH, NOT IN UTICA, NO, IT'S AN ALBANY EXPRESSION.
01:22
I SEE.
01:24
YOU KNOW, THESE HAMBURGERS ARE QUITE SIMILAR
01:26
TO THE ONES THEY HAVE AT KRUSTY BURGER.
01:28
(laughing): OH, NO.
01:30
PATENTED SKINNER BURGERS, OLD FAMILY RECIPE.
01:33
FOR STEAMED HAMS. YES.
01:36
YES AND YOU CALL THEM STEAMED HAMS
01:37
DESPITE THE FACT THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY GRILLED.
01:40
Y-YOU KNOW...
01:44
ONE THING I SH...
01:46
EXCUSE ME FOR ONE SECOND.
01:48
OF COURSE.
01:50
AH, WELL, THAT WAS WONDERFUL.
01:52
GOOD TIME WAS HAD BY ALL. I'M POOPED.
01:54
YES, I SHOULD BE...
01:55
GOOD LORD! WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THERE?
01:57
AURORA BOREALIS.
01:59
AURORA BOREALIS?!
02:02
AT THIS TIME OF YEAR
02:03
AT THIS TIME OF DAY
02:04
IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY
02:06
LOCALIZED ENTIRELY WITHIN YOUR KITCHEN?
02:08
YES.
02:10
MAY I SEE IT?
02:11
NO.
02:13
Skinner's mother: SEYMOUR, THE HOUSE IS ON FIRE!
02:16
NO, MOTHER, IT'S JUST THE NORTHERN LIGHTS.
02:18
WELL, SEYMOUR, YOU ARE AN ODD FELLOW
02:20
BUT I MUST SAY, YOU STEAM A GOOD HAM.
02:25
Skinner's mother: HELP!
02:26
HELP!
02:28
